# Scrollytelling Implementation Debrief - About Page

## Overview
The `/about` page implements a sophisticated scrollytelling experience that combines multiple interactive components to create an engaging narrative about digital safety for families. The page uses modern web technologies including React 18, TypeScript, Framer Motion, and Scrollama.js to deliver a seamless storytelling experience.

## Page Structure

### Main Components
The About page (`src/pages/About.tsx`) consists of two primary sections:

1. **IntroSection** - Hero section with animated title and social media logos
2. **ScrollamaSection** - Main scrollytelling experience with video and interactive steps

## Component Analysis

### 1. IntroSection Component (`src/components/IntroSection.tsx`)
